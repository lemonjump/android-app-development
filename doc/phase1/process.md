#Process

Our team worked on this project closely together mainly by communicating through Facebook message group. For this phase, we had two group meetings in person. We are constantly exchanging opinions and responding to each other's questions through Facebook. For decision making, each team member provides input, votes on the best input and we discuss why we think it's the best idea. We have three user stories in total. We defined the difficulty of one story as high, one as medium and one as low. For their priorities, we determined them to be two as high and one as medium. For our projectâ€™s next phase, we will manage our time more wisely and meet in person more often.
