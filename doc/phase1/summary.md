1)Project objectives
  To provide a way for users to easily store shopping lists that will help them save money by suggesting stores with better pricing based on their previous purchase history. Users will be able to make a list of items they need to buy in advance and the app will arrange the info by store where they can stop to make the least number of trips while being able to purchase the good at their best price. The app will keep track of purchase price history at various stores and product quality to help the user make informed decisions to save money and buy the best quality products. A user will also be able to compare prices of products on the fly to see if they should make an impulse purchase in the moment, or wait to go to a different store to buy the same item cheaper. 
  The app should be easy to use and quicker than consulting and updating a notepad to track grocery lists and previous pricing. Once we finish basic minimal viable product, it will be possible to add more complex features such as cloud storage that can compare prices for various products at nearby stores using a other users' data instead of just a ones own personal database on the phone. Users will also be able to rate the quality of produce as rated by other users that also shop at the same stores. The app should appeal to any persons who have asked themselves the questions: Did I pick up all the groceries I needed? How much did I pay for <item x> at <store x> before again? I swear I've seen this cheaper somewhere else before?


2) Key Personas

  Joseph - an international student who lives on his own and is grocery shopping for the 
first time and is on a tight student budget. Joseph routinely forgets how much pistachios cost
and is always over spending by buying things on an impulse rather than planning ahead. 

  Sherry - Married mother of two, both her and her husband work low paying jobs and 
are living paycheck to paycheck. They want to feed their kids the best possible 
nutritious food but can't always afford it and have a hard time finding best prices
of quality items that they routinely buy. Sherry is looking for an easy way to plan her weekly grocery shopping trips.

  Catherine - Senior citizen who is not very good with computers and technology. Owns a smart phone but can really only use it for rudimentary and the most basic of tasks and mainly has it in case of emergency. She likes the fact that she can keep in touch and up to date with her grandkids on the phone and even uses the Facebook app a bit. As she's getting older, her memory is starting to fade and once when she had no trouble with the weekly routines, at times now she's beginnging to forget to pick up a few items here and there on her grocery trips. 

3)Key Scenarios
  Joseph is out with his friends downtown and remembers that he's out of pistachios at home, his favourite. He pops into a nearby bulk barn and sees that pistachios are selling for $2.50/100g. He opens the app and types "Pistachios”, and is then presented with the prices at stores he normally goes to and is able to make an informed decision whether it's worth it for him to buy on on impulse, or wait until later potentially saving money.

  Sherry wants to purchase groceries today. She opens the app and enters in what her family needs for the week. The app will show the estimated total cost of the groceries based on previous spending and suggest which stores to go to for each item to get the best price. After shopping, she compares her receipts with shopping list on the app and updates prices of groceries if necessary. She can rate the quality of items she puchased and share this data and experience with other users so that others may benefit and create community around local purchases.

  Catherine always shops at the same big grocery store every week as she prefers making as few stops as possible. Throughout the week, whenever Cathy realizes she will need to replenish some items in her home, she quickly adds them to the shopping list app but never bothers with the extra price comparison features. As she is shopping, she checks off the items that she's put into her cart and ensures she hasn't forgotten anything. These simple steps are enough for Cathy who reall doesn't want to interact with the app or her phone anymore than that, except of course unless its to see the latest pictures of her grandkids on Facebook.


4) Key Principles
  Ease of use and speed of use: this information is not hard to track with paper and pen but can be quite tedious and impractical. People are lazy creatures, so our app needs to be convenient enough for people to be able to quickly and easily add items and compare prices. Much of the user base won't be terribly tech savvy either, UI design principles need to take into account that steps in entering and recieving information from app should be obvious and not require much exploration or information in decifering.

  Be helpful: our app can indeed improve our shopping exprience, and help us save good amount of money.
