Catherine is a 70 years old grandmother who is taking care of her two grandchildren. She can use some fundamental application with her cell phone. Since she is getting older and older, her memory starts to get worse. So most of the time, she will bring a shopping list with the stuffs she wants to buy in the market in case she forgets to buy some important stuff(cooking or living). Her son who is a developer in IBM introduced our shopping list app to her. After learning how to use the app, Catherine no longer needs to write a shopping list on the paper. Instead she just records the stuff she wants to buy on the app.  After using the app, Catherine never forgets anything from shopping and she feels really thankful to the app.
Priority: High, as a shopping list app, has the ability to record the list is the most fundamental feature.
Difficulty:Low We just have to create a database which can store the information and be able to update the information.

Sherry - Married mother of two, both her and her husband work low paying jobs andÂ 
are living paycheck to paycheck. Sherry also has two children. Since her family does not have that much money to spend on shopping, she wants to buy the cheapest stuff with the best quality. She feels hard to remember the price and quality of each thing she has bought. Bring a notebook will make her feel inconvenient and she also forgot to bring it with her most of the time. After using our app, she has the ability to keep track of the price for each stuff she bought and she can make comparison with the quality and price of these goods. In this case, she can save a lot of money. Meanwhile, she got the best quality goods to support his family.
Priority High: A shopping list is not good enough, we want to be able to store the previous shopping list and be able to compare the price and quality of each stuff we bought.
Difficulty: Medium, We have to construct a database with various type of object and we need to be able to update and compare these object.

Joseph is a student from Korean who just arrive to Toronto city. He is not familiar with the price of everything in this city. He also have no idea where he can find the store which supply the goods he wants to buy. Luckily, Joseph is a smart guy who like to use his cell phone a lot. So he download our app from the app store. By using our map, he can find all the store nearby him and find the goods(also discount goods) in the store. In this way, he can easily find the stuff he wants to buy in the nearest store and with the cheapest price.
Priority:Medium. If we have enough time left after implementing the features above, we will consider to implement this feature.
Diffucult: Hard, in order to get this feature, we need to have a cloud sever to update the data everyday, and we also have to make some connection with the store so we can update their location and price for the goods.
