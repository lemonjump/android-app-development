#Competition
Price comparing apps are nothing new nowadays, many of them have fancy interfaces and complex functions which brings more confusion than productivity. The app for our project can provide a quick way of viewing/noting keeping prices of products (mainly groceries). The scenario we imagined of users viewing prices in front of shelves of a supermarket to decide if they want to make the purchase. This requires the app to be quick and straightforward enough to make sure users can pull out their devices, launch the app and immediately see what they are expecting to see —— historical prices of the certain product which lies on the shelve. This process must be quick and easy, since people are not likely to spend a long time on investigating whether it’s worthy to buy a 1 dollar apple. The idea is spending little time to save little money for who wants to save every penny. And that’s how we differ ourselves from most other apps.
    
Here are some comparisons on several similar price comparing apps, and what advantages we have.

##RedLaser

RedLaser is a popular app that scans bar code to compare prices on multiple online retailers or ebay. To look for prices, you need to enable your camera through the app, aim at bar code and wait for it to recognize. It can easily compare prices for things like electronics but not very good at finding prices for general groceries. Also it must connects to internet to get prices which makes the process slow sometimes.

##Shopping List

Shopping List has a similar idea with ours on focusing thing on groceries. You need to make a shopping list for it to check the price and tell you which store has the cheapest,so it only focuses on comparing products across nearly by stores. Our app can also provide historic price tracking, when you don’t want to go to another store, just want to decide to buy or not buy depends on whether today’s price is cheaper or more expensive comparing to previous visits.
