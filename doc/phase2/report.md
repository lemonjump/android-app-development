##Initial Planning 
####Definition of scrum master  
1. Scrum master will make sure everyone can choose the task which they prefer the most. Meanwhile, he needs to make sure that the amount of work for each member are fairly equal.  
2. Scrum master will schedule next meeting  time based on everyone’s availability.  
3. Scrum master should assign responsibilities to each member during the meeting.  
4. Scrum master have to take the minutes  during each meeting.  
5. Scrum master have to make sure that everything(job are distributes, question are answered.) is in place at the end of each meeting.  
6. Scrum master need to check the progress of the project regularly.  
7. Scrum master has to choose who is going to be the next scrum master by in initiating a vote.  


####Task size: 
We categorize the size of the tasks based on the time we spend on these tasks. 

- Small: A task size will be considered small if it only takes 30 minutes or less. 
- Medium: A task size will be considered medium if it takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours. 
- Large: A task size will be considered large if it takes between 2 hours and 4 hours. 
- Extra-large: A task size will be considered as extra-large if it takes more than 4 hours to finish. 


##Sprint Backlog
We created a Google Doc where everyone could report their status and take whatever they preferred.

##Review & Retrospective
####What tasks we haven’t done:
- Linking database to the application itself, it’s more complicated than we anticipated and we don’t have enough time to finish it. We use a file to save our data as a temporary alternative. Database will be worked on during the next sprint. 
- There were nothing split before complete

####The process:
- What worked well: 
 - For this sprint, we had our jobs assigned fairly quickly. 
 - We made a clear plan on the prototype that needed to be done.  

- What didn’t work well: 
 - Team members were not too familiar with the working flow, collaboration through Github was underused. 
 - There were some miscommunication and confusion happened within the team. 
 - The plan wasn’t adjusted accordingly due to the fact we started working a little bit late.

- Improvement: 
 - We need to utilize Github more, using issues instead of Facebook chat. 
 - We should adjust our plan more dynamically to make sure the workload is more evenly split.
