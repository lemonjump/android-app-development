## Initial Plan

For this phase, we plan to finish the proposed Minimum Viable Product for our shopping list application. In previous stages of the development process, we built the basic structure of a shopping list application; therefore, in order to achieve our new goals, we need to augment this structure and implement the proposed functionalities.

Most of our effors will be centered on allowing the user to: check off/uncheck items on the shopping list, store purchase information every time a product is acquired, check information about previous purchases for a given product, and, classify the items on the list in a way that users know where to go if they want to get certain items for the lowest price (based on their purchase history). We have decided to split our work in two categories: Back-end and Front-end.

In the process.md document, you will see more details about the way we decided to organize ourselves. The following link includes a set including all the functionalities (listed as user stories) that we decided to implement in this phase:

## Re-planning and Adjusting 
During the previous phase, we were supposed to build the main structure of the SQLite database system (which we are using for data storage); unfortunately, due to some problems, we weren't able to get that done, and therefore, we had to redefine and redesign the back-end structure, so that we could work on that during this stage of the project. We started by re-creating our Android project and migrating only some of the main classes.

## Review and Retrospective
Given that we improved our communication and coordination methods, the plan was completed without any major issues. We had some issues related to Github, but they were mostly caused by our little experience with the system.

In contrast with phase 2, where we only managed to implement the functionalities involving 3 user-cases, this time we managed to implement 10; nevertheless, the implementation of the last one (which focuses screen decorations and UI), has been moved to the last phase of the project.

Everyone was constantly informed of what was being developed thanks to our task's board. We worked on the items with high priority first, and reported new issues as they came up. Every member worked on the items marked as their own responsibility. 

Given the structure of the plan, we finished the most fundamental features of the MVP without any major conflicts, since everyone worked on what they knew how to do best. Given the time constraints, we weren't able to add some interesting functions such as a cloud syncronization system; however, we managed to include helpful features such as a products and stores suggestions' system.

Improvement suggestion: We should communicate with each other more often, in order to avoid conflicts and integrate our application in a better way. Also, we should always try to stay on top of things.

Interesting insights: Given that we were working with technologies some of us have barely used, we came across many issues that we have never encountered before. It is very important to read the available documentation.
